## Watermarking text generated by LLMs with SynthID
We have decided to use the SynthID watermarking algorithm as a means to watermark text generated by LLMs, as it is currently the best in the field.
To verify that this algoirthm works correctly on all possible models, we decided to change the source code slightly in order to use the watermarking algorithm on smaller LLMs, notably OLMO, LLAMA and TINYLLAMA, to see whether model size has an impact on watermarking and its detection.
Furthermore, we want to verify whether the SynthID's claim of being the best watermarking algorithm on the market, we will be benchmarking it against other algorithms.
